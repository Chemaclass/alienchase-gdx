# Alien Chase 2013 Chema Edition

ProTip: this README file is written in plain English. Most of the code for
this project is still in Spanish. I don't know if I'll translate the code
to English, as this is just some sample code that owns to my tutorials,
which are also done in Spanish.

## What is this?
Alien Chase Chema Edition is a space shooter game developed in LibGDX.
This is a remake of Alien Chase 2013 by danirod.

## Is it safe to play?
Yes, it's technically safe. I mean, the game works. You can destroy aliens,
aliens can destroy you, you get the fancy sounds, the images and so.

I may review and fix the code if I have the time. This includes documenting
the code, in order to make it easier to understand, reformatting the code,
maybe adding some unit cases with JUnit if I have to...

## How to get the code/play this
Get the projects. You can archieve this by cloning the repository into your
computer using your favourite Git client. If you don't have a Git client
on your computer --which is a bad idea, as Git is one of those software
pieces that after you try you won't ever forget-- you can get the repository
as a zipball or as a tarball by clicking the "Download ZIP" button that you
may find somewhere in this page, or by manually downloading a release/tag.

Once you get the code, you may open it with Eclipse IDE. I've already
packaged all the required stuff to make the projects work and all the libraries
are already linked inside the repository. To import these projects using
Eclipse IDE, go to File | Import... | Existing projects into workspace,
then go to the folder where you have all the projects, and then import all
of them.

You may play the game by opening the appropiate main class depending on
whether you want to play on Android or on desktop and by running the game
using Run command or Debug command in case you want to debug the code instead.
