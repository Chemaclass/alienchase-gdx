# Alien Chase 2013 Edition

## What is this?
Alien Chase is a space shooter game developed in LibGDX as part of a YouTube
video tutorial series on that library. The goal of the series was to develop
a simple game in LibGDX from scratch and the series already finished with
the deployment of desktop and Android versions of the game.

## Is it safe to play?
NO. The game is not ready for production. It was quickly and dirty done for
educational purposes and it mostly contains bugs or needs some polishment.
I may correct all these bugs and make the code better if I find some time.

## How to play this
First you'll need to get the repository. You may do it by cloning it somewhere
to your computer using a Git client, or by clicking the Download as ZIP
button that you will find on the repository page at GitHub.

Then, open the project will Eclipse and compile it for desktop or for
Android depending on the platform you want to use. That's it.
